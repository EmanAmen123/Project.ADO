Excited to Share My Latest Project: Shop Master Windows Forms Application Using ADO.NET!*

I recently developed a Windows Forms application that interacts with a database using ADO.NET. The project focuses on user login and registration, allowing users to view and store their favorite products while enabling admins to manage products and categories. Here's a breakdown of the project:

Database Design:

Users Table: Stores user credentials for login and registration.

Users (Userld, Username, Password, Email, Age, Address, Role-Admin or User)

Categories Table: Stores product categories (e.g., Electronics, Clothing).

Categories (Categoryld, CategoryName)

Products Table: Stores product details and references the category each product belongs to.

Products (ProductId, ProductName, Price, Categoryld)

Favorites Table: Stores the products a user has marked as their favorites.

Favorites (Userld, ProductId)

Application Structure:


User Pages: Where users can view products and
Login Page

Registration Page

User Pages: Where users can view products and add them to favorites.

Admin Pages: Where admins can manage products, categories, and users.

This project was a fantastic learning experience, allowing me to deepen my understanding of ADO.NET and Windows Forms development.

Looking forward to tackling more challenging projects and exploring new technologies!
